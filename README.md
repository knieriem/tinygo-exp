This repository contains experimental TinyGo based stuff.

Currently there is a hello-world style program, `stm32/eth/`, sending and receiving raw Ethernet packets on a Nucleo H723ZG. The example can be compiled by a [TinyGo version] with added
initial support for STM32H7.

[TinyGo version]: https://github.com/knieriem/tinygo
